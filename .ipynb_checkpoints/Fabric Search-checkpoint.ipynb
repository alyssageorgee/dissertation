       " 'non-woven fabric': ['We form non-woven fabric from the fibre, rather than weaving or knitting. As mentioned above, felt is a non woven fabric as are imitation suede fabrics and wadding. There are many ways that you can create a non-woven fabric, including needling, fluid jet entanglement, adhesive bonding, thermal bonding, chemical bonding, thermal bonding and stitch bonding.'],\n",
       " 'oilcloth': ['Traditionally a plain-woven cotton textile. We coat oilcloth on one side with a drying oil which makes it water-resistant. Oilcloth was one of the first waterproof fabrics. We used it widely before modern laminated alternatives became more commonplace.'],\n",

       " 'panama': ['We weave Panama fabrics in a hopsack weave structure. These fabrics tend to have different weights and qualities and can be anything from canvas to shirting fabric. We often use Panama canvas as embroidery fabric base.'],\n",
       " 'peach skin': ['We weave the majority of peach skin fabrics finely and give them a special treatment which produces a characteristically soft handle.

       " 'poplin': ['Poplin is a very closely woven fabric. It has very fine warp-faced ribs which run in the direction of the weft, caused by the use of around twice as many warp-ends as weft-picks. Incredibly hardwearing, this fabric is prone to creasing and is also susceptible to seam puckering as it has a dense construction.'],\n",
       " 'power net': ['A classic control fabric, Powernet contains enough elastane to make it ideal for body-support clothing due to the high stretch and recovery. A warp-knitted, stretch net textile. We typically use Powernet in heavier weights for foundation wear and control garments, or in more lightweight sheer versions for lingerie.'],\n",
       " 'quilted fabric': ['This is a multi-part fabric. Composed of an outer layer or face fabric with a layer of wadding and sometimes a backing fabric too. We most commonly hold these two or three-layer textile with stitching. You can also fuse it together using either heat or chemicals.'],\n",
       " 'ripstop': ['Ripstop fabric is a textile which incorporates a reinforcement yarn. We call this a ripstop yarn and it is literally there to stop ripping. We weave these yarns into the material at regular intervals to increase the resistance of the fabric to stop tearing.'],\n",
       " 'scuba': ['Scuba is the fashion alternative of Neoprene. A double knit material, scuba is normally synthetic. We make it from a blend of poly and elastane fibres.'],\n",
       " 'taffeta': ['A crisp and lustrous fabric than os woven with warp-faced ribs running in the weft direction. Taffeta has a paper-like quality to it and drapes well in general, however, it is prone to creasing and fraying.'],\n",
       " 'twill': ['Twill fabrics are those woven in a twill weave construction. This weave characteristically produces diagonal lines on the face of the fabric. Using twill weave we can make a heavier fabric than we would with a plain weave. This makes a more hardwearing textile and we often use it for fabrics such as drill and denim.'],\n",
       " 'uv': ['UV fabrics protect against ultraviolet rays. We achieve this protection in a number of ways. We use UV absorbing dyes, UV absorbers or special finishes. Wool absorbs almost all UV rays, and cotton absorbs around 90%.'],\n",
       " 'voile': ['Voile is a lightweight fabric that is sheer and fine. Woven in a plain weave and made with high twist yarns of either natural or synthetic fibres, characteristically voile is a soft fabric with a crisp wiry handle.'],\n",
       " 'waterproof': ['Waterproof fabrics are those which are resistant to penetration by water. Fully resistant textiles would be called waterproof whereas those which are only partially resistant would be called wither-repellant, water-resistant or shower-proof. Waterproof fabrics can be made using fibres which are naturally waterproof, adding protective coatings or finishes, laminating the material or by using a very close weave.'],\n",
       " 'woven fabrics': ['The generic term we use for fabric constructed by interweaving two sets of yarns at 90° angles to each other. Characteristically woven fabrics are strong and stable. This firm, close construction maintains the straight nature of the yarn.'],\n",

       " 'bio lycra': ['This new version of Lycra, Bio Lycra, is ideal for sustainable and eco-conscious designers, as the raw material and production process are both much better for the environment. Rather than man-made material, this new fabric is made from sugars derived from corn. (read more about bio lycra)'],\n",
       " 'coolcore': ['A\\xa0performance fabric that wicks away moisture and keeps the wearer cool during strenuous activity. The textile is able to reduce its surface temperature by up to 30 percent.\\xa0While many performance fabrics use added substances such as polymer crystal treatments to aid in their cooling properties, Coolcore is completely chemical-free. (read more about Coolcore)'],\n",
       " 'eco-leather': ['Eco-Leather is made up of either flax or cotton fibers that are then mixed with plant oils such as palm, soybean, or corn. Any material used is sustainable to keep the textile’s carbon footprint low. This mixture is then layered together to create a material with a similar look and feel to leather. (read more about eco-leather)'],\n",
       " 'inego': ['The dextrose (sugar) that is taken from corn is used as fuel for the creation of the polymer this fiber is made up of. The polymer is formed into Ingeo “pellets” that can be used to make a wide range of products, from electronics to apparel.\\xa0The\\xa0fabric is beautiful, soft, and has performance benefits for sportswear. (read more about inego fabric)'],\n",
       " 'kenaf': ['Made from the Kenaf plant, Kenaf textiles are eco-friendly, naturally very absorbent, and even fire-retardant. The hand of the fabric is similar to linen. (read more about Kenaf)'],\n",
       " 'katazome': ['Literally translated as “stencil-dyed”. \\xa0A\\xa0Japanese method of resist dyeing, similar to Rozome,\\xa0Mainly used to create repeat patterns on fabric, it gained popularity in Japan as a simple, inexpensive way to mimic the look of woven brocades.

       " 'tapa': ['A flexible cloth made from wood. Traditionally made on the island of Tonga, it is created from the bark of the paper mulberry tree. Rather than being knit or woven from a spun thread, the material begins in its original form as a sheet of wood. (read more about Tapa)'],\n",
